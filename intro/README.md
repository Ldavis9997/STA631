Preparation 2 - Connecting RStudio and GitHub
================

All of your work for STA 418/518 will be stored in GitHub. This activity
will walk you through practicing some of the GitHub steps to get more
comfortable with this workflow.

**Estimated Time**

-   ‚òëÔ∏è Six Tasks: 45‚Äì60 minutes

## How to Set up Git

As I said in the syllabus, [Happy Git with R](http://happygitwithr.com/)
is by far the most complete resource for setting up Git and GitHub. If
you would like to set up R, RStudio, Git, and GitHub on your own
machine, I would recommend you use this text. Luckily for us, Git is
already installed on GVSU‚Äôs RStudio Workspace (and of course R and
RStudio are available here too) so we will only need to focus on having
our RStudio sessions communicate with GitHub.

### ‚òëÔ∏è Task 1: Fork this repo

To begin, we need to make your own copy of this GitHub repo.

1.  Click on the ![fork icon](README-img/fork.png) **Fork** icon in the
    upper-right-hand corner of this repo.

After a few seconds, you should be taken to a new repo at
`<username>/preparation02`, where `<username>` is your GitHub username.

### ‚òëÔ∏è Task 2: Configure Git

1.  Login to the [RStudio Workspace](https://rstudio.gvsu.edu/) using
    your GVSU username and password,

2.  Verify that you are in an RStudio session (i.e., not the RStudio
    Workbench Sessions/Project screen).

    There are a couple of ways to configure Git in RStudio. For STA
    418/518, we will use `{usethis}`.

    Note that when you see something like `{name}` in my documents, I
    mean *the R package called `name`*.

    Specifically, we will use the `edit_git_config` function from
    `{usethis}`. Throughout the semester, I will shorten this to be
    `usethis::edit_git_config` or, ‚Äúfrom the R package `usethis`, use
    the function `edit_git_config`‚Äù (in general, `package::function`).

3.  In your **Console** pane (left-hand pane), type the following
    pressing Enter/Return after each line:

    ``` r
    library(usethis)
    edit_git_config()
    ```

    A file should open in the pane above your **Console** that is called
    `.gitconfig`. In this file, copy the information provided below,
    then update it with your preferred name (or pseudonym) and email
    (can be any email, but it would probably be helpful to use the same
    one you signed up for GitHub to avoid confusion). Remember that this
    information will be publicly available.

        [user]
          name = "name"
          email = "user@subdomain.domain"
        [credential]
          helper = cache --timeout=10000000

    Note that in the information above, we are also instructing RStudio
    to remember your GitHub credentials for 10,000,000 seconds (or
    roughly 16 weeks) - the `[credential]` portion. RStudio is not
    remembering your credentials yet, but we will resolve this shortly.

4.  Click on the
    <img src="README-img/save-icon.png" alt="save" width = "20"/> icon
    and you can close this `.gitconfig` file.

### ‚òëÔ∏è Tasks 3: Connect RStudio and GitHub

Now that you have Git set up within RStudio, we can enable RStudio and
GitHub to communicate. To do this, we will need your GitHub username and
a Personal Access Token (PAT). PATs are designed to be more secure than
your password when communicating between your computer session and
GitHub. Conveniently, `{usethis}` has a function for this!

1.  To create a PAT, type the following in your **Console** and press
    Enter/Return:

    ``` r
    create_github_token()
    ```

    Note that you previously loaded `{usethis}` (using
    `library(usethis)`) so I did not ask you to do this again. **Once
    you load a package in your current RStudio session, you do not need
    to load it again.**

2.  You will be directed to a ‚ÄúNew personal access token‚Äù page on GitHub
    in your browser. Since I work on multiple machines (i.e., my
    personal laptop, my work laptop, my personal desktop, and the
    RStudio Workspace), I like to name each PAT. For example, in the
    **Note** text field, I called this token ‚ÄúGVSU RStudio Workspace‚Äù.

    Most of the other options you will accept the default selections.
    However, you might want to change the **Expiration** date. A couple
    of suggestions: have this PAT expire at the end of this semester
    (e.g., Dec.¬†18, 2021) or (*risky*) choose ‚ÄúNo expiration‚Äù. After
    choosing a PAT expiration, scroll down and click on the green
    **Generate Token** button.

3.  After clicking on **Generate Token**, you will be taken to a
    ‚ÄúPersonal access tokens‚Äù page that has a seemingly random string
    presented to you beginning with `ghp_`. Keep this page open for a
    little bit (I will tell you when it is safe to close it), as once
    you close this page, you will never be able to view this PAT again!
    I highly recommend that you store this code somewhere safe (e.g., a
    password manager tool). However, if you do lose it, you can go
    through this process again to create a new one.

4.  Now we need to associate this PAT in RStudio so that RStudio can
    connect to your GitHub account. Back in your RStudio **Console**,
    type the following and press Enter/Return after each line:

    ``` r
    library(gitcreds)
    gitcreds_set()
    ```

5.  In your **Console** you will be asked to
    `? Enter password or token:` Paste your PAT here (NOT your GitHub
    password) and press Enter/Return. You should see a message similar
    to:

        -> Adding new credentials...
        -> Removing credentials from cache...
        -> Done.

### ‚òëÔ∏è Tasks 4: Clone GitHub repo

Now that RStudio and GitHub are connected, we can clone this repo (i.e.,
copy the repo to our RStudio session)!

1.  In RStudio, click on the
    <img src="README-img/rproj-icon.png" alt="RStudio Project" width = "20"/>
    icon (the icon below the Edit drop-down menu);
2.  Click on **Version Control** on the *New Project Wizard* pop-up;
3.  Click on **Git** and you should be on a ‚ÄúClone Git Repository‚Äù page;
4.  Back to your `preparation02` GitHub repo, click on the green
    **Code** button near the top of the page;
5.  Verify that **HTTPS** is underlined in red on the pop-down, then
    copy the URL provided;
6.  Back in RStudio, paste the URL in the ‚ÄúRepository URL‚Äù text field;
7.  The ‚ÄúProject directory name‚Äù text field should have automatically
    populated with `preparation02`. If yours did not, click into this
    box and press Ctrl/Cmd (usually this is a Mac issue);
8.  In the ‚ÄúCreate project as subdirectory of‚Äù field, click on
    **Browse‚Ä¶**. Create a **New Folder** called ‚ÄúSTA 418‚Äù of ‚ÄúSTA 518‚Äù
    (depending on your course), then within this folder, create a **New
    Folder** called ‚ÄúPreparations‚Äù, think click **Choose**. Note that I
    am forcing you to use my file system management style.
9.  Click on **Create Project**.

Your screen should refresh and the **Files** pane should say that you
are currently in your `preparation02` folder that currently has three
files (`.gitignore`, `preparation02.Rproj`, and `README.md`) and a
folder (`README-img/`). If you are asked for your GitHub credentials,
provide your GitHub username and your PAT.

### ‚òëÔ∏è Tasks 5: Create, Edit, Commit, and Push

Before we wrap-up, we will create a new file and see how to commit these
changes and view the commit history.

1.  In RStudio, click on the
    <img src="README-img/new-file-icon.png" alt="new file" width = "20"/>
    and select an R Script,
2.  Click on the
    <img src="README-img/save-icon.png" alt="save" width = "20"/> icon
    to save this file. Name it `preparation02-file.R` (notice the
    capital ‚ÄúR‚Äù for the file type).
3.  Type the following code within in your R script:

``` r
# Here are some simple calculations
2 + 2
(2 * 3)^2
```

4.  Run each line to verify that you get the results you would expect,
    then save your file,

5.  In the **Git** pane (upper-right pane), check the box next to all
    items listed (under the ‚ÄúStaged‚Äù column) and click on
    <img src="README-img/commit-icon.png" alt="commit" width = "20"/>
    **Commit**,

6.  In the pop-up, provide a commit message of
    `Adding some calculations`, then click on **Commit**, and

7.  In this same pop-up, switch from **Changes** to **History**
    (upper-left corner).

    Reflect on how this way of looking through your commit history
    compares to GitHub. Feel free to add more to your R script, save,
    and commit.

8.  To update GitHub with these changes, in the **Git** pane of RStudio
    click on
    <img src="README-img/push-icon.png" alt="push" width = "20"/>
    **Push**. When asked for your GitHub credentials, provide your
    GitHub username and GitHub PAT (as your password). This should be
    the last time you need your GitHub PAT, but I would encourage you to
    keep this in a secure place.

### ‚òëÔ∏è Tasks 6: Wrapping Up

Go back to your `preparation02` GitHub repo and verify that your
`preparation02-file.R` file is here. **You can now close the PAT page
tab.**

There is nothing to submit for this Preparation. However, find the item
that your instructor created in Slack. In this item, reply with what was
the muddiest from the Preparation. If someone else already mentioned
what you thought was muddy, give them a ‚Äú+ 1‚Äù üëç.
